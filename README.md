# Final Project
# Python, Data Science
 This is my final project for my undergraduate thesis defense.

 My final project is to determine the relationship between GPA, lenght of study, and admission path at UNPAR. UNPAR is my university, it stands for Parahyangan Catholic University in Indonesia.

 The data I'm using is .xlsx type and it contains information about UNPAR alumni from all departments. I can't share the data here because it's prohibited from my university.

For the analysis, I'm using two types of analysis, which are descriptive and predictive. For descriptive analysis, I'm using 2 methods. First one is statisctical method such as Pearson Correlation, Chi-Square, and data visualization (scatter plot, box plot) Second one is Clustering such as Agglomerative and K-Means. For predictive analysis, I'm using 2 classification algorithms for making predictive models, which are Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The features for the models is selected by using Chi-Square correlation method.

For the predictive analysis, I deployed my models into a GUI.
